\begin{myminipage} 
     This is the lecture note taken in the course \textit{\courseloc} taught by \profloc{} at \instituteloc{} as part of the \classloc{} program (\sessionloc).
     The content is partly based on the course notes provided by the professor and supplemented by many other references I read myself. The main reason is that the original notes are found a bit ambiguous
     and I want to further clarify.

     Currently, these are just drafts of the lecture notes. There can be typos and mistakes anywhere. So, if you find anything that needs to be corrected or improved, please inform at \myemailloc. \bigskip

     % I am deeply grateful to my late friend, Gilles Castel, who introduced me to \LaTeX{} for the first time.
