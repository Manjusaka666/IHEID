    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Unit (Firm) Fixed Effects:}
        Each firm $i$ has intercept $\alpha_i$. When the number of firms $N$ is large but the time period $T$ is fixed,
        as $N$ increases, the number of these nuisance parameters increases too. The IPP refers to potential bias in the estimation of the structural parameters
        when the number of incidental parameters increases with the sample size.
        Such problem can lead to inconsistency in the estimation of the common parameters,
        because the estimation error in $\alpha_i$ doesn't vanish as $N \to \infty$.
        \item \textbf{Time Fixed Effects:}
        In contrast, time fixed effects add only $T$ dummies, the number of parameters associated with time dummies is fixed. 
        If we perform the within transformation as above, the time dummies remain in the model in the form
        \[\mathbf{1}\{t=\tau\} - \overline{d}_{it} \]
        and if we use first-differences, for any firm $i$, we have:
        \[\Delta  f_t = f_t - f_{t-1} \]
        Thus, the time fixed effects enter the differenced equation as differences, preserving their role in controlling for period-specific shocks.
        Hence, their estimation does not create an incidental parameters problem.
    \end{itemize}
    In short, while unit fixed effects can cause IPP when $T$ is relative small to $N$, 
    the addition of time fixed effects does not because the number of time dummies remains fixed and is asymptotically negligible.

\begin{autosolution}

    For consecutive time periods $t$ and $t-1$, we take the difference and have:
    \[
    \Delta ldsal_{it} = \beta_1 \Delta lemp_{it} + \beta_2 \Delta ldnpt_{it} + \beta_3 \Delta ldrst_{it} + (f_t - f_{t-1}) + \Delta u_{it}
    \]
    Since $\alpha_i$ does not vary over time, it drops out in the differencing.
    For the dummies, we have:
    \begin{gather*}
        \mathbf{1}\{t=\tau\} - \mathbf{1}\{t-1=\tau\}=\begin{cases}
            +1 &\text{if } t=\tau,\\
            -1 &\text{if } t-1=\tau,\\
            0 &\text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \end{gather*}
    

    The time effects appear as differences $f_t - f_{t-1}$.
    Thus, in the first-differenced equation the levels of the year dummies disappear, but their differences remain. 
\end{autosolution}


\begin{autosolution}
    \

    Adding a time-invariant dummy variable to the regression $d357_i$, we get:
    \begin{gather*}
        ldsal_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 lemp_{it} + \beta_2 ldnpt_{it} + \beta_3 ldrst_{it} + \delta d357_i + \sum_{\tau =1}^{T} f_t\mathbf{1}\{t=\tau\} + u_{it}
    \end{gather*}
    We take the first-differences of the equation:
    \[\Delta \delta d357_i = 0.\]
    Thus, in the first-difference model, the term $\delta d357_i$ drops out, and the time dummies are differenced out.
    The IPP arises from having many firm-specific parameters with a limited number of observations.
    So,including a time-invariant dummy does not worsen the IPP since it adds only one parameter that is either absorbed (or eliminated in first differences).

    If we consider Time-Varying Effects of the industry dummy $\delta_t d357_{it}$:
    taking the first-difference, we have:
    \[\Delta(\delta_t d357_{it}) = \delta_t d357_{it} - \delta_{t-1} d357_{i,t-1} = \delta_t - \delta_{t-1}\]
    as $\delta d357_{it} =1$ for all $t$ if the firm is in the computer industry.
    For firms not in industry 357, the term remains zero. Thus, in the first-difference equation, 
    the industry effect appears as the difference $\delta_t - \delta_{t-1}$, which is time-varying.

    Although allowing the industry effect to vary over time introduces several parameters,
    the number of these parameters is tied to the fixed. 
    And the key issue with IPP is the growth of parameters with $N$, which does not occur here.

    As we define $\ddot{y}_{it}= y_{it} - \overline{y}_{it}$ and $\ddot{X}_{it} - \overline{X}_{it}$, we have:
    \[
    \hat{\beta}_{FE-W} = \Bigl( \sum_{i,t} \ddot{X}_{it}^{\prime} \ddot{X}_{it} \Bigr) \sum_{i,t} \ddot{X}_{it} \ddot{y}_{it}

    \[

    The Hausman test statistics is:

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \includegraphics{Hausman.png}
\end{figure}

Hausman test output yields a chi-square statistic of 85.39 (with p-value$ = 0.0000$).

The null hypothesis is strongly rejected, indicating that the RE estimator is inconsistent and that the FE estimator is preferred.
\end{autosolution}

\begin{autosolution}
    \

    Let$\theta = \beta_1 + \beta_2$. Under the null hypothesis, we have
    \[
    H_0: \theta = 1.
    \]
    An estimator for $\theta$ is
    \[
    \hat{\theta} = \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2.
    \]
    Suppose the estimated coefficients $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ have the following variance-covariance matrix:
    \[
    V = \begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) & \operatorname{Cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2) \\
    \operatorname{Cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2) & \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_2)
    \end{pmatrix}.
    \]
    Because $\hat{\theta}$ is a sum of $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$, by the properties of variance we have:
    \[
    \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\theta}) = \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2) = \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) + \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_2) + 2\,\operatorname{Cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2).
    \]
    Under $\mathcal{H}_0$, the deviation of $\hat{\theta}$ from its hypothesized value is:
    \[
    \hat{\theta} - 1 = \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 - 1.
    \]
    Since, by the Central Limit Theorem, $\hat{\theta}$ is approximately normally distributed in large samples, we can standardize the difference:
    \[
    Z = \frac{\hat{\theta} - 1}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(\hat{\theta})}}.
    \]
    Under $H_0$, $Z$ is asymptotically standard normal. Squaring this $Z$ statistic gives a chi-square statistic with 1 degree of freedom:
    \[
    \chi^2 = \frac{(\hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 - 1)^2}{\operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) + \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta}_2) + 2\,\operatorname{Cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2)}.
    \]
    This test statistic is compared to the $\chi^2_1$ distribution.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\chi^2$ is large (and the corresponding p-value is small), we reject $H_0$ and conclude that the sum of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ is statistically different from 1.  
        \item If $\chi^2$ is not large (and the p-value is large), we do not reject $H_0$ and there is no evidence against constant returns to scale.
    \end{itemize}

    At the conventional 5\% level, the p-value (0.0008) is much smaller than 0.05, meaning we reject $\mathcal{H}_0$.
