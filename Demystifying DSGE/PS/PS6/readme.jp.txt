The data are quarterly and are provided in three text files:

  Australian_Data.txt
  Canadian_Data.txt
  New_Zealand_Data.txt

Each of these files is an ASCII file in DOS format. They are zipped in 
the file jp-data.zip. Unix/Linux users should use "unzip -a".

Data sources and samples are detailed carefully in Section 4 of the 
paper. In all three files, variables occur in the same order and are 
labelled by their original moniker for the source data. As an example, 
for Australia the series are:

OBS             Date of Observations
USCPILD400      US CPI
USYDEVQTR       US Output
USFFR           US Interest rate
AU_CPILD400     Australian CPI
AUREERCPINEW    Australian Real Exchange Rate
AU_BB90         Australian Interest Rate
AU_GDPRDEVQTR   Australian Output
AU_GMTOTLD      Australian Terms of Trade
