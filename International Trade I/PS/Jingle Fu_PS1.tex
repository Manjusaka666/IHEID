    Assuming the consumption bundle of Australia(A) before trading with China is $\mathbf{c_1}$ and after is $\mathbf{c_2}$.

    Before China's involvement, according to the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference, we have $\mathbf{p_1} \mathbf{c_1} \leq \mathbf{p_1} \mathbf{c_2}.$

    After China's entering, we have $\mathbf{p_2} \mathbf{c_2} \leq \mathbf{p_2} \mathbf{c_1}.$

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.] For absolute advantage, we compare unit labor productivity directly:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Clothing
                \begin{itemize}
                \item Home: produces $z$ unit per hour.
                \item Foreign: produces 1 unit per hour.
                \end{itemize}
                Home has an absolute advantage in clothing if $z>1$; otherwise, Foreign does.
                \item Food
                \begin{itemize}
                \item Home: produces $z$ unit per hour.
                \item Foreign: produces 4 unit per hour.
                \end{itemize}
                Home has an absolute advantage in food if $z>4$; otherwise, Foreign does.
            \end{itemize}
            Thus, comparing the absolute advantage, we have the following table:
            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                \toprule
                & Clothing & Food \\
                \midrule
                $z>4$ & Home & Home \\
                $1<z<4$ & Home & Foreign \\
                $z<1$ & Foreign & Foreign \\
                \bottomrule
                \end{tabular}
            \end{table}
        \item[2.] For comparative advantage, we compare the opportunity cost of producing one unit of one good in terms of the other good:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Home: The opportunity cost of 1 unit of Clothing over 1 unit of Food is: $\frac{a_C}{a_F} = 1$.
                \item Foreign: The opportunity cost of 1 unit of Clothing over 1 unit of Food is: $\frac{a_C^*}{a_F^*} = 4$.
            \end{itemize}
            Thus, Home has a comparative advantage in Clothing, and Foreign has a comparative advantage in Food, regardless of $z$.
        \item[3.] If $z=2$, the relative price of Clothing is $P = \frac{P_C}{P_F} = \frac{a_C}{a_F} = 1$, $P^* = \frac{a_C^*}{a_F^*} = 4$.\\
            $Q_C = \frac{L}{a_C} = 2000 = Q_F$, $Q_C^* = \frac{L^*}{a_C^*} = 1000$, $Q_F^* = \frac{L^*}{a_F^*} = 4000.$

                \item[(a)] Draw the world relative supply of clothing.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item When $P<1$, both Home and Foreign produce only Food, giving $R = \frac{Q_C + Q_C^*}{Q_F + Q_F^*} = 0$;
                        \item When $P=1$, Home can vary production between $(\text{Clothing}, \text{Food}) = \Bigl[(2000, 0), (0,2000)\Bigr]$ and Foreign produces only Food, giving $R \in [0, 0.5]$;
                        \item When $1<P<4$, Home produces only Clothing and Foreign produces only Food, giving $R = 0.5$;
                        \item When $P=4$, Home produces only Clothing and Foreign can vary production between $(\text{Clothing}, \text{Food}) = \Bigl[(0,4000), (1000, 0)\Bigr]$, giving $R \in [0.5, \infty)$;
                        \item When $P>4$, both Home and Foreign produce only Clothing, giving $R = \infty$.

                \item[(c)] In Home, a worker produces $z=2$ units of Clothing per hour, hence the value of one hour's output is: $w = 2 P_C$;
                While in foreign, a worker produces 4 units of Food per hour, having a value of $p^* = 4 P_F$.
                Given that $\frac{P_C}{P_F} = 2$, we know it that $\frac{w}{w^*} = 1.$
            \end{enumerate}
        \item[4.] As analyzed before, the change of $z$ won't affect the world relative price.
        We assume that after the change both countries remain completely specialized in their comparative-advantage goods.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[(a)] Home produces $1000z$ units of Clothing, and Foreign produces 4000 unnits of food.
                The world relative supply of Clothing is $R = \frac{1000z}{4000} = \frac{z}{4}$.

                For Home, a worker's nominal income is $w = z P_C$, and for Foreign, $w^* = 4 P_F$.

                Our Cobb-Douglas utility with equal share tells us that $P = \frac{P_C}{P_F} = \frac{Q_F}{Q_C} = \frac{1}{R}$, thus $P = \frac{4}{z}$.

                Thus the free-trade relative price is $\frac{P_C}{P_F} = \frac{4}{z}$, the wage ratio is:
                \[\frac{w}{w^*} = \frac{z P_C}{4 P_F} = 1. \]
                \item[(b)] If $z$ increases, the relative price $P = \frac{4}{z}$ decreases, since the 
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Two-by-Two-by-Two with Fixed Coefficients]
    \
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.] 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Relative Factor Abundance:} $RFA_A = \frac{K_A}{L_A} = \frac{420}{460} \approx 1.095$, $RFA_G = \frac{K_G}{L_G} = \frac{900}{600} = 1.5$. Thus Germany is relatively capital abundant and Austria is relatively labor abundant.
            \item \textbf{Relative Factor Intensity of Goods:} $RFIG_B = \frac{a_{KB}}{a_{LB}} = 3$, $RFIG_S = \frac{a_{KS}}{a_{LS}} = 0.5$. Thus Buns are capital intensive, while Sausages are labor intensive.
            \item \textbf{Comparative Advantage:} By the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, the relatively capital-abundant country, Germany, 
            will have a comparative advantage in the capital-intensive good, Buns, 
            and the relatively labor-abundant country, Austria, in the labor-intensive good, Sausages.
            \item \textbf{Autarkic Relative Price:} In autarky, each country's relative price reflects its ``shadow'' cost. Because factor prices adjust differently in each country (with the excess factor receiving a zero ``price''), we expect:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Austria: As labor is in excess, the wage is set to 0, hence $P_A = \frac{P_{BA}}{P_{SA}} = \frac{a_{KB}}{a_{KS}} = 3$;
                    \item Germany: As capital is in excess, the rental rate is set to 0, hence $P_G = \frac{P_{BG}}{P_{SG}} = \frac{a_{LB}}{a_{LS}} = \frac{1}{2}$.
                \end{itemize}
                Thus, the autarkic price of Buns is higher in Austria than in Germany. Under trade we expect Germany to export Buns and Austria to export Sausages.
            \item \textbf{Free Trade:} Under trade we expect Germany to export Buns and Austria to export Sausages.
        \end{itemize}

        \item[2.] We separate the two countries' production functions and factor endowments: $B = Q_{BA} + Q_{BG}$, $S = Q_{SA} + Q_{SG}$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(a)] For Austria, the full employment conditions are:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Labor:} 
                \[ L_A = a_{LB} Q_{BA} + a_{LS} Q_{SA} \Rightarrow Q_{BA} + 2 Q_{SA} = 420\]
                \item \textbf{Capital:}
                \[ K_A = a_{KB} Q_{BA} + a_{KS} Q_{SA} \Rightarrow 3 Q_{BA} + Q_{SA} = 460\]
            \end{itemize}
            Both constraints hold with equality, we can have: $(Q_{BA}, Q_{SA}) = (100, 160).$

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Labor:} 
                \[ L_G = a_{LB} Q_{BG} + a_{LS} Q_{SG} \Rightarrow Q_{BG} + 2 Q_{SG} = 600\]
                \item \textbf{Capital:}
                \[ K_G = a_{KB} Q_{BG} + a_{KS} Q_{SG} \Rightarrow 3 Q_{BG} + Q_{SG} = 900\]
            \end{itemize}
            Solve the equations, we have: $(Q_{BG}, Q_{SG}) = (240, 180).$

        \item[3.] Consumers have Leontief preferences (they want to consume 1 Bun and 1 Sausage per hotdog). Because the consumption ratio is fixed at 1, autarkic equilibrium production must satisfy $B=S$.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[(a)] We first find the ebalanced production point in both countries:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Austria: 
                            \begin{align*}
                                \text{Labor: } & B + 2B \leq 420 \\
                                \text{Capital: } & 3B + B \leq 460
                            \end{align*}
                            The binding constraint is capital, so the maximum balanced production in Austria is $B = S = 115$.
                        \item Germany:
                            \begin{align*}
                                \text{Labor: } & B + 2B \leq 600 \\
                                \text{Capital: } & 3B + B \leq 900
                            \end{align*}
                            The binding constraint is labor, so the maximum balanced production in Germany is $B = S = 200$.
                    \end{itemize}
                    The autarkic relative price is set by the zero-profit conditions.

                    For Austria, as balanced production $(115, 115)$ lies in the interior of the production possibilities frontier, labor is in excess. (Thus $W = 0$, and prices are determined solely by the rental rate $R$.)

                    In Germany, capital is in excess, so $R = 0$.

                    The zero-profit conditions then are:
                        \begin{align*}
                            P_{BA} &= W + 3R = 3R \\
                            P_{SA} &= 2W + R = R \\
                            P_{BG} &= W \\
                            P_{SG} &= 2W
                        \end{align*}
                    These relative prices are in line with our prediction from part (1).

                \item[(b)] In Austria, labor is in excess, hence $W=0$.  Total national income is $R\cdot K_A = 460R.$
                Each hotdog costs $P_{BA} + P_{SA} = 4R$, so each owner of a unit of capital can buy $\frac{R}{4R} = \frac{1}{4}$ hotdogs.
                
                In Germany, capital is in excess, so $R = 0$. Total income is $W \cdot L_G = 600W$.
                Each hotdog costs $P_{BG} + P_{SG} = 3W$, so each worker can buy $\frac{W}{3W} = \frac{1}{3}$ hotdogs.
            \end{enumerate} 
    \end{enumerate}
