# Feedback and Corrections for Applied Work

I have verified your `.tex` file against the requirements and the output tables generated by your `trade.ipynb` code.

**Overall Status:**
*   **Structure:** Excellent. You have addressed all questions (a-m).
*   **Code:** The R code (`trade.ipynb`) is robust and generates all necessary tables.
*   **Consistency:** There are significant discrepancies between the numbers in your `.tex` text and the actual tables generated by the code. It seems the text reflects an earlier version of the results.

Below are the specific corrections required. Grouped by Question.

## Question e: Currency Union Effect Estimation

**Observation:** The coefficients in your text do not match `table e_basic_gravity.tex`.

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> The CU coefficient is negative and insignificant in specifications (b) and (c), but becomes positive (0.593) and significant when country fixed effects are included.

**Suggested Modification:**
> The CU coefficient is negative and insignificant in specifications (b) and (c), but becomes positive (**0.641**) and significant when country fixed effects are included.

## Question h: Year-by-Year Regressions

**Observation:** You mentioned the results are not shown, but your code generates `table h_yearly_cu.tex`. You should include this table and analyze the trend, which is quite striking (effect disappears in later years).

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> Although the year-by-year regression results are not shown in the provided tables, the analysis would reveal whether the currency union effect varies over time...

**Suggested Modification:**
> **Table 2 presents the results of year-by-year regressions with country fixed effects.**
>
> \input{table h_yearly_cu.tex}
>
> The results show a strong positive effect of currency unions from 1960 to 1990, with coefficients ranging from 0.60 to 1.45. However, **the effect declines sharply after 1995**, becoming statistically insignificant in 2000 (0.008) and 2005 (0.215). This suggests that the trade-promoting effect of currency unions may have diminished in recent decades, or that the introduction of the Euro (which dominates the recent CU observations) has different characteristics than earlier unions.

## Question i: Critiques and Country-Pair Fixed Effects

**Observation:** The coefficients in your text do not match `table i_pair_fe.tex`.

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> The country-pair fixed effects specification yields a CU coefficient of 0.446***, implying a 56% increase in trade...

**Suggested Modification:**
> The country-pair fixed effects specification yields a CU coefficient of **0.660***, implying a **93%** increase in trade ($e^{0.660} - 1 = 0.93$). This is slightly larger than the **0.641** estimate with country fixed effects, suggesting that controlling for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity reinforces the positive CU effect in the static panel setting.

## Question j: High-Dimensional Fixed Effects

**Observation:** The coefficients in your text do not match `table j_structural_gravity.tex`.

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> Spec (1) ... yields a CU coefficient of 0.490**, ... Spec (2) ... yields a CU coefficient of 0.349***...

**Suggested Modification:**
> 1. **Specification (1) - Time-varying MRTs**: Controlling for exporter-year and importer-year fixed effects yields a CU coefficient of **0.633***, implying an **88%** increase in trade.
>
> 2. **Specification (2) - Adding pair fixed effects**: Further controlling for pair fixed effects yields a CU coefficient of **0.308***, implying a **36%** increase in trade. This significant drop (from 0.660 in the simple Pair FE model) illustrates the importance of controlling for *both* time-varying multilateral resistances and time-invariant pair heterogeneity simultaneously.

## Question k: Small Countries

**Observation:** Your text discusses dummy variables (`cu_small_o`, etc.), but your code now uses an interaction with continuous GDP (`cu:ln_gdp_avg`). The interpretation needs to change.

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> ...The interaction terms (cu_small_o, cu_small_d, cu_both_small) are positive but insignificant...

**Suggested Modification:**
> To test if small countries benefit more, we interact the CU dummy with the average log GDP of the pair (`cu $\times$ ln_gdp_avg`).
>
> In Specification (1) (Full Controls), the interaction term is **negative and significant (-0.185**)**. This implies that the trade-creating effect of currency unions **decreases** as the size of the countries increases—supporting the hypothesis that small countries benefit more.
>
> However, in Specification (2) with Pair Fixed Effects, the interaction becomes positive but **statistically insignificant (0.038)**. This suggests that once we control for time-invariant pair characteristics, there is no robust evidence that country size modulates the currency union effect.

## Question l: PPML Estimation

**Observation:** Your text cites 0.027 (insig), but the table says -0.122 (insig).

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> The PPML estimate of the CU coefficient is 0.027 and insignificant...

**Suggested Modification:**
> The PPML estimate of the CU coefficient is **-0.122** and statistically insignificant. This confirms that when accounting for zero trade flows and heteroskedasticity, the currency union effect disappears, casting doubt on the robustness of the log-linear results.

## Question m: Euro Effect

**Observation:** Your text cites -0.613, but the table says -0.135 (insig) for Euro, and +0.496** for Other CUs.

### Correction
**Original Text:**
> The euro_cu coefficient is -0.613***...

**Suggested Modification:**
> The analysis distinguishes between the Eurozone and other currency unions. The results show:
>
> 1.  **Euro Effect**: The coefficient for the Euro dummy is **-0.135** and statistically insignificant.
> 2.  **Other CUs**: The coefficient for other currency unions is **0.496** and significant at the 5% level.
>
> This suggests that while traditional currency unions (often post-colonial or small-state associations) are associated with higher trade, the introduction of the Euro has *not* led to a statistically significant increase in trade among its members (controlling for RTAs and pair heterogeneity). The "negative" point estimate, though insignificant, aligns with the literature suggesting that the Euro's trade effect is either small or elusive when proper econometric controls are applied.
