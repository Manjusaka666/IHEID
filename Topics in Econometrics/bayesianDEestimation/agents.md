YOU ARE CODEX. DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS. DO NOT RUN ANY CODE. DO NOT CREATE ANY NEW DIRECTORIES.
WORK STRICTLY INSIDE THE EXISTING REPO STRUCTURE bayesianDEestimation/.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (HARD):
(1) DO NOT execute Rscript, make, or any command that regenerates results.
(2) DO NOT introduce ANY new numeric value anywhere in the manuscript (no new percentages, N, dates, coefficients, p-values, horizons counts, etc).
(3) Every numeric claim that remains must be (a) already present in existing output files under results/, and (b) tied to a specific table/figure/CSV/latex_table source reference.
(4) Prefer removing inline numbers from prose: put all quantitative evidence in existing tables/figures and refer to them textually.
(5) Maintain EI137 guideline compliance and top-journal narrative discipline.
(6) Do NOT change the repo directory structure; new files allowed ONLY at repo root (e.g., INTERNAL_MAPPING.md, CHANGELOG.md, REPLICATION.md).

TOP-JOURNAL QUALITY REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Ensure the revised submission reads like a top-field empirical note:
- Narrative complete: clear question → contribution → design → evidence → interpretation → limitations → future work.
- Logic coherent and unambiguous: no contradictions across abstract/results/conclusion; no “two stories”.
- Theory/econometrics accurate and rigorous: correct statements about nested-model forecast tests; correct role/limits of CG-style revision regressions; correct description of hierarchical BVAR shrinkage.
- Interpretation error-free and disciplined: no causal claims unless identified; explicitly separate “incremental information content” from “belief distortion/DE proxy”.
- Economic meaning rich: explain mechanisms (information overlap; inflation forecast difficulty; DE channel) in a way that is insightful but does not rely on new numbers.
Your edits must improve clarity, coherence, and rigor at every paragraph while staying within the guideline’s term-paper expectations.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Revise ForecastingHorseRace.tex (submission main text target 8–10 pages; must be within 5–10 per guideline) to satisfy BOTH:
(A) EI137 Term Paper Guidelines: concise intro with contributions/results by end of page 1; literature review is second part of intro organized around your contribution; clear section openings/closings; formalities.
(B) Top-journal standards above.
Keep an extended version with appendix material, but the submission main text is the grading target.

FILES TO EDIT:
- ForecastingHorseRace.tex
- ref.bib
FILES TO CREATE (ROOT ONLY, no new dirs):
- INTERNAL_MAPPING.md (short, auditable mapping of manuscript tables/figures to existing outputs)
- CHANGELOG.md (optional; no numbers)

========================================================
STEP 1 — Create INTERNAL_MAPPING.md (MANDATORY, SHORT, AUDITABLE)
========================================================
Create root file INTERNAL_MAPPING.md with:
1) A short mapping table: Manuscript Item -> Exact source path in repo
   - Include only items referenced in submission main text + any appendix items explicitly cited.
   - Sources must be actual existing files under results/ (tables/, latex_tables/, figures/, robustness/, diagnostics/).
2) A “Numerical Integrity Rule” paragraph:
   “All quantitative values in the paper are contained exclusively in the referenced tables/figures generated by the existing pipeline; the prose contains no standalone numeric claims. Any quantitative statement in the prose must point to a mapped item.”

Rules:
- DO NOT invent filenames. Discover actual filenames by reading the repo.
- Keep it short and focused.

========================================================
STEP 2 — Numerical integrity sweep (STRICT: NO NEW NUMBERS)
========================================================
In ForecastingHorseRace.tex:
A) Remove or rewrite any sentence that contains a numeric claim in prose.
B) If some digits are unavoidable (section numbers, table numbers), ensure they do not introduce new empirical quantities.
C) Remove all sample-size/date/forecast-origin counts from prose; replace with “see Appendix (Sample Accounting)” if such a table exists, otherwise refer to the already-generated design table/notes without adding new numbers.
D) Ensure every referenced Table/Figure/Appendix item appears in INTERNAL_MAPPING.md.

Static check rule:
- Search the tex for digits 0–9 in prose paragraphs. Remove any empirical numbers. Keep digits only in:
  - section numbering, table/figure numbering, citations/year inside bibliography (allowed), or in imported tables.
- Eliminate “?”, “??”, “REF??” and any unresolved \cite keys.

========================================================
STEP 3 — Rewrite for top-journal narrative completeness (NO NUMBERS)
========================================================
Rewrite/reshape the manuscript so it reads like a coherent AER/QJE-style short note, without adding numbers:

A) Abstract (tight; no numbers):
- One sentence: question.
- One sentence: empirical design (nested information sets + hierarchical BVAR + pseudo-OOS).
- One sentence: main RMSFE take-away (refer to mapped Table for quantitative evidence).
- One sentence: main revision-diagnostic/DE take-away (refer to mapped table).
- One sentence: interpretation discipline (diagnostic, non-causal).

B) Introduction (must satisfy guideline’s page-1 rule):
- By end of page 1, explicitly state (in crisp prose or bullets):
  (i) research question,
  (ii) contributions (two items),
  (iii) approach,
  (iv) headline qualitative results (table references only).
- Second part of intro: “Related literature” organized by contribution strands (2–3 sentences each):
  1) Diagnostic expectations / belief distortions + revision diagnostics (Bordalo et al.; CG)
  2) Consumer confidence forecasting (classic results + real-time skepticism)
  3) Inflation is hard to forecast; parsimonious benchmarks often competitive
  4) Hierarchical BVAR shrinkage / prior selection
Make each strand explicitly tied to what your paper adds.

C) Methods section (rigorous but concise; no numeric hyperparameters):
- Provide minimal VAR model skeleton and explain:
  - nested information sets,
  - recursive pseudo-OOS setup (qualitatively),
  - evaluation metrics (RMSFE; revision diagnostic),
  - what hierarchical shrinkage does conceptually.
- Add a concise nested-inference caveat paragraph:
  “Because models are nested, standard equal-accuracy tests can be distorted; we therefore emphasize magnitude/stability and report a nested-robust test in the appendix.”
- Add a short “Implementation map” paragraph pointing to INTERNAL_MAPPING.md and the results folder, explaining how tables/figures are produced (no commands; no reruns).

D) Results section (interpretation-driven; no numbers):
- Start with “Main takeaways” bullets (qualitative, no numbers).
- Discuss Table-based evidence only via references:
  - Point forecast accuracy / incremental predictive content
  - Revision dynamics and DE proxy interpretation
- Add a short “Economic interpretation” subsection:
  - Information overlap: financial variables may subsume sentiment for pointTE point forecasts.
  - Long-horizon inflation: forecast difficulty and benchmark competitiveness.
  - DE framing: sentiment as diagnosticity proxy affects revision dynamics more than RMSFE.
- Add a “Limitations” paragraph:
  - CG-style regression on model forecasts is diagnostic; alternative sources: shrinkage/misspecification/structural change.
  - State what would overturn conclusions (state dependence; alternative sentiment; real-time data; density forecasts).

E) Conclusion (shorter than abstract; no numbers):
- Restate contributions + qualitative findings + disciplined limitations.
- Future work (3 bullets max): state dependence; alternative sentiment measures (text/media); density forecasts / real-time data.

========================================================
STEP 4 — References upgrade in ref.bib (rigor + credibility)
========================================================
In ref.bib:
- Add/verify clean BibTeX entries for core references that strengthen your top-journal narrative:
  - Bordalo et al. (AER) diagnostic expectations / overreaction evidence
  - Bordalo et al. (JEP) overview
  - Coibion & Gorodnichenko (AER) revision diagnostic foundation
  - Carroll-Fuhrer-Wilcox (AER) consumer sentiment & spending
  - Bram & Ludvigson (NY Fed EPR) confidence forecasting
  - Croushore (real-time evidence: confidence can be weak/worsen forecasts)
  - Atkeson & Ohanian; Stock & Watson (inflation forecasting difficulty/benchmarks)
  - Giannone-Lenza-Primiceri (hierarchical prior selection for VARs)
  - Clark-West + Clark-McCracken (nested forecast tests)
  - Kuschnig & Vashold (BVAR JSS) + CRAN package reference
- Remove/replace any unverifiable citations.
- Ensure every in-text citation resolves and appears in bibliography.

========================================================
STEP 5 — Page-length control WITHOUT compiling
========================================================
Since you cannot compile:
- Enforce concision by editing:
  - Intro ≤ about 2 pages
  - Data ≤ about 1 page
  - Methods ≤ about 3–4 pages
  - Results ≤ about 3 pages
  - Conclusion ≤ about 1 page
- Move anything lengthy to appendix blocks (if already present) or delete redundant prose.
- DO NOT add new long content; prioritize sharper writing and better structure.

========================================================
STEP 6 — Consistency & rigor checks (static)
========================================================
- Confirm there is exactly ONE consistent storyline:
  - sentiment’s incremental RMSFE contribution (Table reference)
  - sentiment’s role in revision dynamics / DE proxy (Table reference)
- Confirm no overclaiming:
  - use “consistent with” language for DE interpretations,
  - emphasize “diagnostic/descriptive” unless identification exists.
- Ensure each section begins with purpose/link paragraph and ends with takeaway paragraph (guideline + top-journal readability).
- Ensure every Table/Figure reference is mapped in INTERNAL_MAPPING.md.

========================================================
STEP 7 — Changelog (optional but recommended; no numbers)
========================================================
Create root CHANGELOG.md with bullet points:
- narrative reframing to DE proxy
- removal of inline numeric claims
- mapping file created
- citations added/cleaned
- any structural edits (moved content to appendix; condensed sections)

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated ForecastingHorseRace.tex
- Updated ref.bib
- New INTERNAL_MAPPING.md at repo root

END. EXECUTE ALL STEPS.
