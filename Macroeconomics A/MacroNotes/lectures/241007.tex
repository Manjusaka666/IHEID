\textbf{Business Cycle Facts I}

We'll study the \textbf{detrended macro times series:}
\[ x_t = \log (X_t) - \log (X_t^{\ast}) \]
is the percentage deviation of variable $X$ from its trend $X^{\ast}$.

How's the trend?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1.] First linear,
  
  \item[2.] more sophisticated filters: Baxter-King(Bankpass) filter,
  Hodrick-Prescott(HP) filter
\end{enumerate}

Linear: just run OLS regression and use residuals.

\textbf{Business Cycle Facts III:}

Governmetn spending, not strongly correlated with level of output, main driver
of business cycles.

Real wage is mildly pro-cyclical: average wage evolves differently than the
wage of a continuously employed worker

\

$U_C (C, 1 - L) > 0, U_{C C} (C, 1 - L) < 0$ and $U_L (C, 1 - L) > 0$, $U_{L
L} (C, 1 - L) < 0$
