column 2: date
column 3: real country interest rate, annualized, percent (0.01=1%)
column 4: real U.S. interest rate,  annualized, percent (0.01=1%)
Note. The U.S. real interest rate is computed as the difference between the 3-month Tbill rate and average inflation over the past 4 quarters. 
Inflation is measured using the U.S. GDP deflator. The 3-month T-bill rate is the average rate over the quarter. 
In Uribe and Yue, by contrast, the interest rate is measured as the rate at the beginning of the quarter.
