\section{1st-best Fiscal Policy Under Fixed Exchange Rates}
\textbf{Labor Subsidies}
Government subsidized employment at the firm level at the rate $s_t^h$.
The profits of the firm are given by:
\[
\phi_t = p_t F(h_t) - (1-s_t^h) w_t h_t.
\]
The optimal condition for the firm is:
\[
p_t = (1-s_t^h) \frac{w_t}{F^{\prime} (h_t)}.
\]

Negative shock $\Rightarrow$ subsidy $\Rightarrow$ higher employment $\Rightarrow$ No subsidy
